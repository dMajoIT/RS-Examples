# PAM-N Signal Integrity Automator

**Automated signal integrity analysis for Automotive Ethernet PAM-N signals using the R&S RTP oscilloscope.**

Developed by R&S Application Engineering to streamline 2.5 / 5 / 10 GBASE-T1 measurements that would otherwise require many manual steps on the instrument.

---

## Overview

This tool provides a graphical interface that controls an R&S RTP oscilloscope over a network connection (TCPIP/VISA). It automates signal configuration, eye diagram setup, and advanced jitter decomposition — replacing repetitive manual instrument operation with a single button press.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PAM_AE_SignalIntegrity_GUI.py` | Main application — run this to launch the tool |
| `PAM_AE_SignalIntegrity_Backend.py` | Instrument automation functions (SCPI over VISA) |

---

## Requirements

**Python 3.10 or higher**

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install RsInstrument
```

Tkinter is included with standard Python on Windows. No other packages required.

---

## How to Run

```bash
python PAM_AE_SignalIntegrity_GUI.py
```

---

## Features

### Signal Configuration
- Selectable channel pair: CH1+CH3 or CH2+CH4
- Creates a DIFF1 differential signal automatically
- Technology presets: 2.5 / 5 / 10 GBASE-T1
- Configurable vertical and horizontal scaling
- Factory preset + full reconfiguration in one click

### Eye Diagram
- **Software CDR**: Whole eye, specific eye (Eye1/2/3), or selected transition
- **Hardware CDR**: CDR trigger lock with optional zoom window
  - Zoom coordinates configurable in nanoseconds
  - Zoom window automatically removed and recreated on each run

### Jitter Analysis
- **Quick Start**: Fully automatic — instrument detects bit rate and enables all components
- **Manual Components**: Select any combination of DDJ, RJ, TJ, DJ, PJ, DCD
- **PAM-N Results**: Transition-dependent histograms for all six PAM-4 rising transitions (0→1, 0→2, 0→3, 1→2, 1→3, 2→3)


## Instrument Connection

1. Connect the R&S RTP oscilloscope to the same network as your PC
2. Find the instrument IP address on the scope: **Setup → Network**
3. Enter the IP in the **Connection** tab and click **Connect**

Default IP pre-filled: `10.103.34.23` — change this to match your instrument.

## Building a Standalone Executable

To distribute the tool without requiring Python to be installed:

```bash
pip install cx_freeze
python setup.py build
```

The `build/` folder will contain `SignalIntegrityAutomator.exe` and all dependencies. Use `setup.py` from the repository.

## SCPI Reference

All SCPI commands are sourced from the **R&S RTP Oscilloscope User Manual**.

Key command areas used:
- `ADVJitter1:*` — Advanced jitter decomposition (instance 1)
- `EYE1:*` — Eye diagram configuration
- `TRIGger1:TYPE CDR` — Hardware CDR trigger
- `LAYout:ZOOM:ADD / REMove` — Zoom window management
- `SIGNalconfig:SETup:ADD` — Technology standard preset

---

## Known Instrument Behaviour

- The HW CDR zoom window may take a few seconds to render after being created — this is normal instrument pipeline behaviour, not a code issue.
- `CLEJitcomp` (jitter decomposition reset) can take 60–120 seconds depending on signal complexity. The log shows live progress ticks every 15 seconds.
- 10GBASE-T1 at ~3.8 GBd symbol rate may not lock with HW CDR — SW CDR is recommended for this standard.
